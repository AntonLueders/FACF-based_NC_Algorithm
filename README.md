# FACF_Based_NC_Algorithm
This repository contains the software written for the manuscript "Connection between the noise-cancellation algorithm for Brownian particles and the force autocorrelation function and its applicability to arbitrary overdamped systems" by A. LÃ¼ders, S. Mandal, and T. Franosch. The NC Algorithm [Mandal et al. PRL 2019] is implemented using the FACF.
